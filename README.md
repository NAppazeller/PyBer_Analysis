# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview:

The purpose of the project is to perform a data analysis for a ride sharing app company. The analysis will include the use of data visualization through a variety of charts that will show the relationships between the type of city and the number of riders and drivers. Additionally, the analysis will include the percentage of total fares, riders, drivers and fares by type of city.

The analysis will improve access to ride sharing services and improve affordability to underserved neighborhoods.

## Results:

  * *Urban Ride Sharing*
  
  The urban ride sharing program included 2,405 drivers who provided 1,625 rides with fares totaling $39,854 during the period of 1 January 2019 through 8 May 2019. Average     fare per urban rider and driver was $16.57 where the average fare per ride was $24.53.

  * *Suburban Ride Sharing*

  The suburban ride sharing program included 490 drivers who provided 625 rides with fares totaling $19,356 during the period of 1 January 2019 through 8 May 2019. Average     fare per suburban rider and driver was $39.50 where the average fare per ride was $30.97.
  
  * *Rural Ride Sharing*

  The rural ride sharing program included 78 drivers who provided 125 rides with fares totaling $4,328 during the period of 1 January 2019 through 8 May 2019. Average fare per rural rider and driver was $55.49 where the average fare per ride was $34.62.


## Summary:

A deeper analysis would be warranted for the following data discrepancies:

* Urban fares drop mid-January where it rises in suburban and rural cities. What is the reason for the drop?
* Urban fares fluctuate significantly in March compared to suburban and rural cities. What is the reason for the fluctuation?
* Urban average fare per ride is 48% higher than the average fare per driver/rider. Suburban and rural average fare per ride is 22% and 38% lower, respectively, than the average fare per driver/rider. What is driving the higher average fare per ride for urban cities?
