# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview:

The purpose of the project is to perform a data analysis for a ride sharing app company. The analysis will include the use of data visualization through a variety of charts that will show the relationships between the type of city and the number of riders and drivers. Additionally, the analysis will include the percentage of total fares, riders, drivers and fares by type of city.

The analysis will improve access to ride sharing services and improve affordability to underserved neighborhoods.
